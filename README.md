# InstanceLoadouts

Never forget to change your specialization, talents, gear, or addon presets ever again!

**Note:** Requires [_AbstractFramework_](https://addons.wago.io/addons/mKOv2E6x) in order to function. Due to limitations with Wago and WowUp's packaging, must be installed separately for now. Installed automatically with _CurseForge_ directly.

## Features

Create custom loadouts for each instance type. The addon will remind you to switch your spec, talents, equipment set, and addon profile when entering:

*   Dungeons
*   Raids
*   Delves
*   Arena
*   Battlegrounds
*   Open World

Current season dungeons and raids are tracked by default. You can add other instances from the Encounter Journal. Custom raid encounters require manually entering NPC IDs.

Share your loadouts using the built-in import/export feature.

*   `config` or `c` - Open configuration UI
*   `changelog` or `log` - Show changelog
*   `import` - Import a loadout
*   `export` - Export a loadout

## Known Issues

*   Targeting bosses inside of Raids does not work for choosing boss-specific loadouts. This is due to their Units being strictly "Secret" under Midnight's new addon restrictions. I'll look if a solution is even plausible before the Raid drops officially.
